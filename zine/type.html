        <p>
          California's state Legislature is reopening that high-stakes, decades-long debate, as it prepares to vote on a proposal that would give hundreds of thousands of contract workers, such as Uber and Lyft drivers, new benefits by legally reclassifying them as employees.

        <p>"Everyone is looking to California right now and they're all following it with bated breath because they recognize that likely whatever happens in California is going to sweep across the country," says Monique Ngo-Bonnici, 
          a private attorney who represents businesses.</p>

<p>The proposal expands on a landmark California Supreme Court ruling last year that extended wage protections to more workers and narrowed the definition of "independent contractor." 
         The legislative proposal expands on that ruling and would give workers benefits like paid sick leave and protections under anti-discrimination laws.

Ngo-Bonnici argues that the California proposal would put big constraints on workers and companies alike.
         Specifically, it would mean more workers will be put on shifts, which in certain municipalities must be scheduled weeks in advance — giving workers far less flexibility, she says.

Lyft confirms it would have to revamp its operations in the state if drivers are reclassified as employees.


"We would need far fewer drivers than we currently have," says Adrian Durbin, a Lyft spokesman. And those that remained would have a much more rigid work schedule.

        </p>
        <p>
          Durbin says Lyft and other similar gig companies pushed California lawmakers for a middle ground that would grant independent contractors a narrower set of benefits, like minimum wage guarantees, without making them full-fledged employees.Those prospects dimmed after California Gov. Gavin Newsom this week publicly endorsed the measure.
