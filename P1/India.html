<h1>INDIA<h1>
  <h2>India’s mounting pile of old smartphones, laptops, and refrigerators could create over half-a-million jobs.
Every year, India churns out more than two million tonnes of e-waste a figure that is expected to surpass five million tonnes by 2020.
More than 95% of India’s e-waste is processed by a widely distributed network of informal workers of waste pickers. They are often referred to as “kabadiwalas” or “raddiwalas” who collect, dismantle and recycle it and operate illegally outside of any regulated or formal organisational system.
