  		When people get a new smartphone, computer, or any other device,
  		 they have to waste their devices that people don’t need to use more. 
  		But, where their electronic waste will go? Here are some places their waste could turn up: many recycling centers choose to ship their electronic waste to developing countries to lower the cost. Countries such as China, Nigeria, India accept tons of electronic waste from Western countries every year. 


  	 <br><br>Informal recycling in developing countries is typically unlicensed and unregulated. At these informal recycling workplaces, men, women, and children recover valuable materials by burning devices. Usually, they
  	  do not wear protective equipment and lack any awareness that they 
  	  are handling dangerous materials. In the face of these health and environmental hazards, however, many people in developing countries keep their life by taking apart, repairing and reselling used electronic devices. It means any electronic waste that is sent to a developing country will harm the environment in the same way. Electronic waste 
  	  itself represents a symbol of a high standard of living or economic wealth. Ironically, such a lot of electronic waste ends up in very populated regions of developing countries. 


  	 <br><br>Until last year, China accepted 70 percent of the world’s electronic waste: abandoned computers, cell phones, printers, televisions, and other electronic parts. After China stopped accepting this e-waste out of concern for its environment, Western countries began shipping more of it to Southeast Asia, but now India and Nigeria, whose ports have been overwhelmed, are limiting imported e-waste as well. So, now where can we dispose of our e-waste? Many developed countries still trying to use developing countries, even it is limited. But we all are living on the same earth together. They are actually just putting off their responsibility, but the results are the same. Wherever the e-waste is sent and stayed, the environment will collapse together, also it will affect human health. So, you and Developed countries should find the other solution. </h1>
